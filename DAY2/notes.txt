Time Complexity 
Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.

Space Complexity
Space complexity is the amount of memory used by the algorithm to execute.

Asymptotic Notations
Asymptotic notation describes the algorithm's efficiency and performance in a meaningful way.

Types of Asymptotic notations:-
Big O (O):-
Used to denote Worst case complexity.
Big Omega (Ω):-
Used to denote best-case complexity.
Theta (Θ):-
Used to denote average-case complexity.


Various Time Complexities
Constant Time Complexity:-  O(1)
Linear Time Complexity:- O(n)
Quadratic Time Complexity:- O(n^2)
Logarithmic Time Complexity:- O(log base2 n)
Exponential Time Complexity:- O(2^n)
